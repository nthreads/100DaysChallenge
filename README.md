## LC # 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

  **Example 1:**
  ```
  Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
  Output: 5
  Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
  Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
  ```

  **Example 2:**
  ```
  Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
  Output: 0
  Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
  ```
